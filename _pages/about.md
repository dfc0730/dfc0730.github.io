I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Automation](https://zidonghua.just.edu.cn/), [Jiangsu University of Science and Technology](https://www.just.edu.cn/). I have done some research on car control algorithms and power electronics technology, and now I'm very interested in computer vision.

I participated in several competitions during my undergraduate studies, including the National College Students Intelligent Car Race, the Jiangsu Robot Competition, and the Challenge Cup competition. I am honored to have been granted a recommendation-free admission qualification at Jiangsu University of Science and Technology and have been recommended to the [Faculty of Robot Science and Engineering](http://www.rse.neu.edu.cn/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.neu.edu.cn/)
